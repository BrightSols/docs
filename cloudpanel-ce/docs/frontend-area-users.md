On this page you will find information about **SSH/SFTP** and **FTP** Users.

## SSH Users

The SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. 
It provides several alternative options for strong authentication, and it protects the communications security and integrity with strong encryption.

### Add a User

To add a new **SSH User** click on the button **Add User** top right. 

Enter a **User Name** and a strong **Password**. 
CloudPanel automatically adds the suffix **-ssh** at the end of the **User Name** to prevent conflicts with system users.
The **Password** needs to be at least six characters long; the longer, the better.
